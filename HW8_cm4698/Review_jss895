### Color Selection:
The colors were selected correctly, they do not pressent any visualization problems, not even for color blind people.


### Other comments:
It is not clear why is the graph useful (it only shows that in states with higher population there was more people living in urban areas), if what you are trying to say is that in the 1800's there was a relatively constant proportion between people living in urban areas and total population in different states in the US, maybe instead of using a count of people living in urban areas you should have used the proportion on the Y axis.Given that there are only a few observations, labeling them could be a good idea, to see how one state compared to another one.
In terms of your legend, I think it would be betterif instead of calling the line "OLS regression" you called it "Fitted line", because a line is not a regression, it is something you draw given the results of a regression.
Finally I would recommend to state more clearly the meaning of the graph and why it shows something interesting.
