Assignment 1:

Since I worked with Dana on the first round of our CitiBike data project, we worked together again on this second piece. While I compiled the code and figures for running a chi square test, she pulled in additional months worth of data and expanded the scope of our 'night time' proxy from midnight to 8p-7a.

We worked together in Authorea to write up our report. I mostly wrote the Abstract and Methods sections, as well as pulled in figure images from our notebooks. Dana contributed to the introduction and conclusion mainly, as well as the styling components of our paper.

Assignment 2:

Completed most/all of this assignment in class with Professor Vo.

I worked with Matt Dwyer to translate our SQL assignment into a jupyter notebook. We also completed the extra credit assignment together and recorded our results in two locations: the Assignment 2 notebook, which won't run unless you change the kernel from python 2 to 3, and a separate extra credit notebook, which should run right away as long as the kernel is set to python 3.
