### Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

**Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?**

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

Null hypothesis (H0): The avg % of weight lost by people in the test sample on a diet and in the test sample on an exercise regime 
is not statistically different or the exercise sample lost more weight.
Formula (H0): P0 (or Pt) <= Pc

Formula (H1): Pt > Pc

**Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.** (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children of smokers and non-smokers at age 1, 2, 3, and 4 years.

Null hypothesis: When comparing children of the same age, do children of smokers have equal or higher IQs than children on non-smokers?
Forumula: Comparing the distribution of IQs measured between the two groups at each age.

H0: Mean IQ scores for children whose mothers smoke (10+/day) during pregnancy are same as mean for those whose mothers do not smoke.
Formula (H0): Pt = Pc

Formula (H1): Pt < Pc

**Contribute to the incidence of diabetes** 
Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods,
usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.

This is not a lab experiment, but you have data the incidence of diabetes for the US population.
No control experiment, just testing distribution of 

Null hypothesis: there is no spatial correlation
