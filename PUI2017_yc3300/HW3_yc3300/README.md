# Assignment 1: Write an ipython notebook that demonstrates visually in a data-driven way the Central Limit Theorem.

Goal:
GENERATE 100 samples of different sizes N (N>10 & N<2000) from each of 5 different distributions (500 samples in total), all with the same population mean
Include a Normal, a Poisson, a Binomial, a Chi-Squared distribution, and 1 more of your choice.
For each sample plot the sample mean (dependent var.) against the sample size N (independent var.) (if you want you can do it with the sample standard deviation as well).
Describe the behavior you see in the plots in terms of the law of large numbers.
PLOT the distributions of all sample means (together for all distributions). Mandatory: as a histogram. Optional: in any other way you think is convincing
Extra Credit: FIT a gaussian to the distribution of means

Process:
I copied and pasted Professor's skeleton she did for chisq distribution and I changed distribution and assigned std to each distribution
For extra credit, Rachel Lim (Lim Xin Rong) helped me with creating an empty list and an i loop, she said that she learnt this method from Alex. I had difficulties finishing extra credit, so I followed what she told me 

# Assignment 2: Set up the work for data-driven inference based on CitiBike data. You should, even more than usual, work in groups for this!

Process:
For this question I also copied professor's example and substituted "women" to "Customer" and "Men" to "Subscriber"
I worked with Rachel Lim and Unisse Chua on this question. 
Initialy I had trouble downloading data so Unisse taught me to create a loop, however it didn't work, therefore I went to Rachel and found out 
she is also doing Subscriber and Customer and she is using professor's structure, so I followed her code, which is the same as the professor's code.

# Assignment 3: Finish z-test lab and turn it in as a notebook .

Process:
This question has some similarities with the example we have done in class. 
I have followed a little bit from what we did in class and used the formula that professor has provided us. 
I had some difficulties on distinguish the std whether it should be population std or sample std, Rachel Lim helped me with the question,
and we figured out the conclusion whether we need to reject hypothesis or not together
