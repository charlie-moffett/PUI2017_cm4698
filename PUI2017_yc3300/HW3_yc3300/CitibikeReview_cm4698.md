# a. verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly

Based on her idea that customers are less likely than subscribers to choose biking for commuting, Yu formulated her Null hypothesis incorrectly. Instead of "the ratio of Subscriber biking on weekends over Subscriber biking on weekdays" being "the same or higher than the ratio of Customer biking over weekends to Customer biking on weekdays", her Null Hypothesis should have stated that the Subscriber ratio is the same or lower than that of the Customer ratio.
