Assignment 1: Time series clustering exercise

I worked primarily with Gaurav on this assignment. I followed along with his manner of plotting the various time series clustering analyses and data cleaning, though the interpretations were entirely my own.

Assignment 2: K-Means clustering optimization animation (lab)

This was a continuation of our in-class lab, where I completed most of my work with my partner Praveen. The notebook then is based off of the skeleton we created in class, with the addition of a loop to optimize the clustering. I've rendered it as an animation within the notebook.
