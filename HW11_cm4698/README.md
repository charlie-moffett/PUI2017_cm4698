Assignment 1: Time series clustering exercise



Assignment 2: K-Means clustering optimization animation (lab)

This was a continuation of our in-class lab, where I completed most of my work with my partner Praveen. The notebook then is based off of the skeleton we created in class, with the addition of a loop to optimize the clustering. I've rendered it as an animation within the notebook.
