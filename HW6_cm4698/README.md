Assignment 1:

I worked with Gaurav for a majority of this assignment. Once I had set up my notebook for reproducibility, I looked on to his method of cleaning the datasets and merging energy consumption with PLUTO data to produce our final dataset. Once I had properly dropped unnecessary columns, changed column names, etc., Gaurav showed me the best method for plotting the important variables against one another and producing plots that zoomed into the bulk of the datapoints as well as then plotting the log of each against each other.
