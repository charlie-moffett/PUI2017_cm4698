Original Visualization

Clarity

This map from Rachel is wonderfully easy to read, and the choice to represent counts is plenty clear. I would perhaps drop the zeros after the decimal point in the legend. I like that she calls out that its a cloropleth, demonstrating a widely used urban viz tool.

Esthetic

Green is great for representing trees and it works well here too. The highest bin looks like there a few outliers, which would be cool to see, so maybe the bins could be sized differently or just a special color for the zip with the most trees. May look great next to a similar map of all of the london pines mapped as points.

Honesty: Again, very clear and not really hiding anything whatsoever. Perhaps normalizing the data in some way would ground the data some how but otherwise no deformation. Nice work!

Appendix

CLARITY: is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?
ESTHETIC: beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?
HONESTY: is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?
