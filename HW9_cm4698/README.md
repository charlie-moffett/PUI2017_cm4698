Assignment 1: reviews of classmates' plots

I reviewed plots for Anupama and Rachel and created a markdown file in my HW9 repository. Included the plot as an image that renders in my markdown file and my review of the plot in English prose, full sentences.

I also uploaded my review markdown files to each of my peer's HW8 repos. This required forking their PUI2017 repos, git adding my reviews, and then submitting merge requests to each peer.

The evaluations were made politely, along the lines of clarity, esthetic, and honesty.

Assignment 2: census geospatial analysis

I worked together with Matt Dwyer and Sunglyoung Kim throughout most steps of this assignment. As a group we figured out how to pull in the PUMA and AFF datasets, clean up our features, and plot our maps. They also helped me with reading in my API key correctly. All of the interpretation (represented in my figure captions) I did on my own.
