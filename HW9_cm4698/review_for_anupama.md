Peer Review for Anupama Santhost

![Natural Gas Usage NYC](https://github.com/Anupama16/PUI2017_as11566/blob/master/HW8_as11566/Quartile_Image.PNG)

Clarity

Her figure caption gives great context for a good looking map. The decision to represent gas consumption using quartiles is interesting choice and quite relevant as an urban study. Highlighting the Brooklyn community districts (if that's what is used here - could benefit from a reference somewhere) is accurate. The legend could use some indication what a quartile's range is, and a more informative title.

Esthetic

If the story for this visualization is intended to draw the viewer to Brooklyn, I would recommend using a color other than gray for the highest quartile. Otherwise, the distinct symbology is useful and functional. The grid and axes could potentially be removed.

Honesty

I think Anupama honestly visualizes her data here, since quartile is a specific method for splitting up bins. It would be interesting to see if different areas within Brooklyn would show different colors if equivalent or jenks was used. Nice work!


Appendix

CLARITY: is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?
ESTHETIC: beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?
HONESTY: is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?
