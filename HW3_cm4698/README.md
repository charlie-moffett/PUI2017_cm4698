Assignment 1: Central Limit Theorem Viz

For this assignment, I worked with a number of peers throughout the week and relied a fair amount on 
Professor Bianco's skeleton notebook and Lab 3.

Praveen helped me set up the my constants and universal variables.

From Professor Bianco's skeleton notebook I borrowed the distribution and plotting means, with additionalhelp from Matt and Dana. Sarah also helped me understand how to set the right parameters for the various distributions.

Assignment 2: Data-driven inference based on CitiBike data

I set up notebook and dataframe following professor's example.

Dana C. and I worked together to formulate our hypotheses and clean the data. I was having difficulty loading in the data as well, so while I worked to resolve that I followed along with her analysis and ended up using the same results to disprove our null hypothesis.

Assignment 3: Z-test Lab

This assignment we started in class, and Professor Bianco's walk-through of part of the lab was helpful
for figuring out the formulas and hypothesis development. 

I worked with Rebecca, Emily, Dana, and Matt to compare the statistics and conclusions about the Null
hypothesis. I also received some insight from Rachel on describing the data and validating my means and
standards of deviaton.
