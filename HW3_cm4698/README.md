Assignment 1: Central Limit Theorem Viz

For this assignment, I worked with a number of peers throughout the week and relied a fair amount on 
Professor Bianco's skeleton notebook and Lab 3.

Praveen helped me set up the my constants and universal variables.

From Professor Bianco's skeleton notebook I borrowed the distribution and plotting means, with additionalhelp from Matt and Dana. Sarah also helped me understand how to set the right parameters for the various distributions.
