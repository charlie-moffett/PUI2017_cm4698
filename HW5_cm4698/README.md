Assignment 1:

I worked with Matt Sauter to set up my z score formula, plot the distribution of z scores and fit it against the normal distribution I had created previously. I mostly followed along for this portion as I'm still getting a grip on z-score tests. The KS test I ran was set up with code I learned from Professor Bianco's lab notebook on proving z test in class.

Assignment 2:

I used Professor Bianco's 'oh my goodness of fit' lab notebook to guide the first half of my work. A good deal of the second part of the assignment I accomplished by following along with Matt Sauter. In particular, his work to increase lambda on the Poisson was pivotal to my ability to plot the results, and my discussion of results was similarly impacted by the coding I witnessed him perform as we worked together.

Assignment 3:

Here I worked with Matt Sauter and Valeria to pull in the right CSVs from PUIDATA, drop/rename columns, and merge the various data sets regarding gun ownership and global population stats.

I worked alongside Matt Dwyer and Matt Sauter to nail down the modeling portion. We struggled together a bit with incorporating the US data point without entirely skewing the plots.
