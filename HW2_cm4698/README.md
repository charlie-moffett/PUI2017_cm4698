HW2 for PUI2017

Assignment 1: tracking each vehicle for a line

For this assignment I worked with Jack Lundquist, Matt Dwyer, and Prince
Abunku from our cohort, with the following split:

Jack: showed me how to format my URL as to include the MTA API key and Bus Line, and we worked together on indexing the Siri JSON file in order to print the current position of each bus
Prince: helped me more so with organizing my files in Github and navigating terminal

Assignment 2: next stop information

For this assignment I worked with Praveen. He showed me how to print the output text to a CSV file. We wrote the rest of our scripts ourselves.
